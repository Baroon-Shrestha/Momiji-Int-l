  interested in nursing care, food service, civil engineering, or academic
  studies, we are here to walk beside you every step of the way. At Momiji, we
  believe that education is more than just books — it is preparation for life.

  interview preparation, and language courses designed to help you succeed in
  Japan's competitive and dynamic environment. We understand that moving abroad
  is a big step. That’s why we are not just a consultancy — we are a family. A
  family that listens, guides, and stands by you from the first inquiry to your
  successful settlement in Japan. Thousands of students have already taken the
  step forward with Momiji.
